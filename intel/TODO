1) Update to 'offical' libfabric v1.0; current code is based on
   libfabric 1.0-rc3, rc6 became offical 1.0.

2) Remove all instances of FI_* error codes, replace with std linux errno.h
   codes.

3) Replace all instances of fi_* to kfi_*.
	Perhaps starting with include/net/kfi/fi*.h renamed to kfi*.h.
	rename *.h file contents, fi_*, FI_* --> kfi_*, KFI_*.
	fix kfi/ prov/ibverbs/ & tests/[getinfo,mm2].

4) Set fi_strerror() full-text output to be under KFI_DEBUG.

5) Complete the verbs provider such that Infiniband & iWARP devices supported.

6) Fix makefiles. Both the kfi and provider makefiles should be made to properly
   depend on compat-rdma (when available, if not just use system's kernel/IB stack).
   I think the compat-rdma kernel modules have in mind some sort of scheme where
   a dependent module includes config.mk in the Makefile, and then includes one
   or more of the auto-generated headers to pick the right compat defines.
   However this does not work. Section 4 of the OFED_tips.txt which talks about
   this is outdated and/or incorrect. Perhaps a bug needs to be filed.
